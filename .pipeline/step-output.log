## Phase 3: Build Complete! 🎉

I've successfully implemented Phase 3, transforming the read-only kanban board into a fully interactive CRUD application. Here's what was built:

### ✅ Components Created (11 new files)
1. **API Utility** (`src/utils/api.ts`) - Type-safe API wrapper with error handling
2. **Button** - Reusable button with variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost)
3. **Modal** - Accessible modal using Headless UI Dialog
4. **ConfirmDialog** - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
5. **FormInput** - Reusable input with validation display
6. **ColorPicker** - 6-color grid picker for cards
7. **EditableText** - Inline editing with Enter/Escape keyboard shortcuts
8. **CreateCardModal** - Form for creating new cards
9. **EditCardModal** - Form for editing existing cards (includes delete)
10. **CreateBoardModal** - Form for creating new boards
11. **BoardList** - Homepage board grid with create functionality

### ✅ Components Updated (4 files)
1. **Board.tsx** - Added complete state management with all CRUD handlers for boards, columns, and cards
2. **Column.tsx** - Added inline editing, delete button, reorder arrows, and "Add Card" button
3. **Card.tsx** - Made clickable for editing, added up/down reorder arrows
4. **Pages** - Updated homepage and board detail page to use new interactive components

### ✅ Features Implemented

**Board Management:**
- ✅ Create new boards from homepage
- ✅ Edit board name inline (click to edit)
- ✅ Delete boards with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Navigate between boards

**Column Management:**
- ✅ Add columns to boards
- ✅ Edit column names inline
- ✅ Delete columns (with cascade warning)
- ✅ Reorder columns with left/right arrows

**Card Management:**
- ✅ Create cards in columns
- ✅ Edit card details (title, description, color)
- ✅ Delete cards from edit modal
- ✅ Reorder cards within columns with up/down arrows
- ✅ 6-color picker (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, gray)

**UX Features:**
- ✅ Optimistic updates (UI updates immediately)
- ✅ Error handling with rollback
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- ✅ Loading states on buttons
- ✅ Form validation

### ✅ Quality Checks
- ✅ All 60 repository tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds with no errors
- ✅ Installed Headless UI (~30KB) for accessibility
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance

### 🎯 What's Ready to Test
You can now:
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
2. Create, edit, and delete boards from the homepage
3. Add, rename, reorder, and delete columns
4. Create, edit, reorder, and delete cards
5. Change card colors using the color picker
6. All changes persist to the SQLite database

### 📋 Next Steps: Phase 4
The only remaining MVP feature is **Drag & Drop**:
- Replace arrow buttons with drag-and-drop for columns
- Replace arrow buttons with drag-and-drop for cards
- Enable dragging cards between columns
- Add touch support for mobile
- Visual feedback during drag operations

**Phase 3 is complete and ready for testing!** The app is now fully interactive with all CRUD operations working. Only drag-and-drop remains for the complete MVP experience.
