Perfect! I've written a comprehensive Phase 2 reflection. Here's what it covers:

## Summary of Key Findings:

**What Went Well:**
- Phase 1 patterns scaled perfectly (repository, API, component patterns)
- Bottom-up build order (DB → API → UI) validated again
- Error handling and loading states were built-in from the start
- Test quality is exceptional (100% coverage on critical paths, 83 passing tests)
- Integer gap positioning strategy worked elegantly
- Native HTML5 drag-and-drop required no libraries

**Critical Gap Identified:**
- **No E2E tests** — BRIEF.md line 29 requires Playwright tests for UI features, but Phase 2 deferred them to Phase 3. This is a deviation from the project brief.

**Looking Forward:**
- **Phase 3 should build Cards** — The final MVP feature including card CRUD, drag-within-column, drag-between-columns, color labels, and **Playwright E2E tests**
- After Phase 3, if all BRIEF.md features work with E2E coverage, write "PROJECT COMPLETE"

**Technical Debt:**
- Position rebalancing unimplemented (risk of integer overflow after many reorders)
- E2E test requirement not met
- Component tests skip user interactions
- Minor: uncovered error path in connection.ts

**Process Improvements:**
- E2E test requirements must be explicit acceptance criteria (not just mentioned in testing strategy)
- Document deviations from BRIEF.md in reviews
- Extract position gap strategy to shared utility for Phase 3 reuse

The reflection provides actionable guidance for Phase 3 and ensures the next spec writer knows exactly what needs to be built to complete the MVP.
