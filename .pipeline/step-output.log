Perfect! I've written a comprehensive reflection document for Phase 7. Let me provide you with a summary of what I found:

## Phase 7 Reflection Summary

I've completed the reflection for Phase 7 (Color Filter feature) and written it to `docs/phases/phase-7/REFLECTIONS.md`.

### Key Findings

**What Went Well:**
- Feature delivered completely — all acceptance criteria met
- Review step caught a critical flaky E2E test before it could cause CI/CD issues
- Real SQLite in unit tests continues to catch edge cases
- Client-side filtering architecture scaled cleanly
- URL persistence pattern reused perfectly from text search
- All accessibility standards maintained

**What Didn't Work:**
- E2E test had flaky selector (using `getByPlaceholder('Add a card...')` became ambiguous after cards were created)
- Missing drag-and-drop test on filtered cards initially
- Documentation had duplicate "URL Persistence" sections

**All MUST-FIX Items Completed:**
1. ✅ Fixed flaky E2E test (added `.first()` to disambiguate selectors)
2. ✅ Added missing drag-and-drop E2E test
3. ✅ Consolidated duplicate documentation sections
4. ✅ Improved type safety (`readonly string[]` for initialColors)

**Test Results:**
- 249 unit/component tests passing
- 24 E2E tests passing (12 scenarios × 2 browsers) — 100% consistent, no flakiness
- Zero TypeScript errors

### Looking Forward

**MVP Status:** The core MVP from BRIEF.md is complete (all 6 features delivered). Phase 7 was a post-MVP enhancement.

**Recommended Next Phase:** "Filter by no color + Dark mode" — two small, focused enhancements building on existing infrastructure:
- Add 7th color chip for "no color" filtering
- Add dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
- Update all components for dark mode styling
- Estimated scope similar to Phase 7 (~1 day)

**Process Improvements:**
- Continue mandatory review step (caught critical issues)
- Map acceptance criteria to specific test cases in PLAN.md (would have prevented missing test)
- Better selector discipline in E2E test planning
- Continue using real SQLite in unit tests (no mocking)

The phase delivered a clean, production-ready color filter feature with comprehensive test coverage and zero known issues.
