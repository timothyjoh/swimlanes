Perfect! I've created a comprehensive, detailed implementation plan for Phase 3. Here's what the plan delivers:

## Summary

The plan provides a complete roadmap for implementing Phase 3 with 11 vertical slice tasks:

### Key Decisions Made (resolving all open questions):

1. **Positioning Utility Extraction** — Created first (Task 1) so both columns and cards use it from day one
2. **Color Labels** — 6 predefined colors stored as TEXT in database, validated in UI component only
3. **Card Description Display** — Shown inline on all cards (not modal or expand/collapse)
4. **Drag-Between-Columns API** — Single endpoint `/api/cards/:id/column` updates both column_id AND position atomically
5. **E2E Test Timing** — Playwright installed in Task 5 (after API exists, before UI complete) for TDD approach
6. **Card Edit UX** — Inline editing (click to edit) matching column editing pattern

### Task Breakdown:

1. **Extract Positioning Utility** — Share logic between columns/cards
2. **Database Migration** — cards table with CASCADE DELETE
3. **Card Repository** — 7 functions with full validation
4. **Card API Routes** — 5 RESTful endpoints
5. **Playwright Setup** — Install and configure E2E tests
6. **CardManager Create/List** — Basic card rendering and creation
7. **CardManager Edit/Delete** — Inline editing and deletion
8. **CardManager Drag Within Column** — Reordering cards
9. **CardManager Drag Between Columns** — Cross-column card moves
10. **Playwright E2E Tests** — 8+ test scenarios covering all MVP features
11. **Documentation Updates** — AGENTS.md and README.md

### What Makes This Plan Strong:

✅ **Specific code snippets** — Every task includes exact file paths and code examples
✅ **Bottom-up build order** — DB → API → UI validated from Phases 1 & 2
✅ **Vertical slices** — Each task delivers testable functionality end-to-end
✅ **Test requirements** — 20+ DB tests, 25+ API tests, 8+ component tests, 8+ E2E tests
✅ **Success criteria** — Clear acceptance criteria for each task
✅ **Risk assessment** — Identifies 5 key risks with mitigations
✅ **No open questions** — Every decision made and justified
✅ **Scope boundaries** — Explicit "What We're NOT Doing" section
✅ **Lessons applied** — Incorporates all Phase 2 REFLECTIONS.md recommendations

The plan is ready for implementation. All RESEARCH.md open questions have been resolved with concrete decisions.
