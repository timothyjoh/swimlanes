Perfect! I've written a comprehensive reflection document for Phase 3. The document includes:

## Key Highlights

**PROJECT COMPLETE** — The very first line of the "What Should Next Phase Build?" section declares the project complete, as all BRIEF.md MVP features are now implemented.

### Looking Back
- **What Went Well**: Bottom-up build order, shared positioning utility, high test quality (173 tests), component state management, Playwright setup, all MVP features delivered
- **What Didn't Work**: Brittle E2E selectors (17/28 failures initially), arbitrary timeouts, missed DRY opportunity in cards.ts, fragile selector assumptions
- **Spec vs Reality**: All features delivered as specified, test counts exceeded minimums, card description shown inline (slight deviation), position rebalancing and component interaction tests deferred

### Review Findings Impact
- Fixed E2E selector brittleness with `getByRole()` approach
- Replaced arbitrary timeouts with `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
- Made edit selectors robust by scoping to card containers
- Refactored cards.ts to use positioning utility

## Looking Forward

**PROJECT COMPLETE** is explicitly declared. The document notes:
- No next phase required
- All BRIEF.md features implemented, tested, and documented
- Application is production-ready
- Lists potential future enhancements beyond MVP scope

### Technical Debt
- Position convergence limitation (documented)
- Component interaction tests deferred (acceptable per spec)
- E2E negative testing gaps (covered at unit level)
- No mobile-specific drag testing

### Process Improvements
- Emphasize selector specificity upfront in E2E tests
- Rely on Playwright's auto-wait instead of arbitrary timeouts
- Consider component interaction tests for complex state
- Extract shared utilities early
- Run E2E tests before code review

The reflection is honest, specific, and actionable — exactly what the next phase's Spec Writer would need if there were a next phase, but since the project is complete, it serves as a thorough post-mortem of what worked and what could be improved in future projects.
