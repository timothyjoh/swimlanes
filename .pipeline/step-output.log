Perfect! I've written a comprehensive reflection document. Let me create a summary for you:

## Reflection Document Completed

I've analyzed Phase 1 by reading:
- The SPEC, PLAN, RESEARCH, and REVIEW documents
- The MUST-FIX document showing all 6 issues were resolved
- The BRIEF to understand remaining project goals
- Git history and test results

### Key Findings

**What Went Well:**
- Clean greenfield scaffold with all dependencies working on first try
- Rock-solid database layer (13 tests, 93%+ coverage)
- Bottom-up vertical slice approach (DB → API → UI) caught issues early
- Review process identified critical gaps that would have caused production failures

**What Didn't Work:**
- Component test was a facade (only checked `typeof === "function"`)
- Error handling was completely absent initially (API crashes, silent UI failures)
- No operational feedback (loading states, error messages)
- Review came too late (after "done" rather than during implementation)

**Spec Compliance:** 100% - All 10 acceptance criteria met, plus enhancements (error handling, loading states, extra tests)

**Review Impact:** All 6 findings (3 critical, 3 minor) were fixed successfully. Tests grew from 28 to 32, all passing.

### Recommendations for Phase 2

**What to build:** Columns (Swim Lanes) - the logical next layer. Users should be able to navigate to a board detail page and create/rename/reorder/delete columns. Cards come in Phase 3.

**Process improvements:**
- Write error handling into specs explicitly
- Define test requirements concretably (no vague "smoke test")
- Integrate review during implementation, not after
- Add "definition of done" checklist including error paths

The reflection document is ready at `docs/phases/phase-1/REFLECTIONS.md` and provides the detailed context the next phase's Spec Writer will need.
