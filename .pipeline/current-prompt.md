# Implement Phase

You are the Build Agent. Your job is to implement this phase according to the plan.

## Context — Read These First

1. **Phase Spec**: `docs/phases/phase-2/SPEC.md` — what we're building
2. **Phase Research**: `docs/phases/phase-2/RESEARCH.md` — codebase state
3. **Phase Plan**: `docs/phases/phase-2/PLAN.md` — how to build it (follow this closely)

Current phase: 2

## Instructions

1. **Follow the PLAN.md task list** — implement each task in order
2. **Write tests alongside code** — not after. Each vertical slice includes its tests.
3. **Run tests frequently** — after each task, run the test suite. Fix failures immediately.
4. **Run coverage** — confirm coverage is not decreasing from previous phases
5. **Follow existing patterns** — RESEARCH.md documents the conventions. Use them.
6. **Update documentation**:
   - Update **CLAUDE.md** with any new commands, conventions, or architecture decisions
   - Update **README.md** with any new features, scripts, or usage changes
   - Documentation is part of "done"

## Quality Gates (before finishing)

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage is not decreasing
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns from RESEARCH.md
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated if needed
- [ ] README.md updated if needed
- [ ] No compiler/linter warnings

## Important

- If you encounter something not covered in the PLAN, make a reasonable decision and document it
- If a planned approach doesn't work, adapt but stay within the SPEC's scope
- DO NOT add features not in the SPEC — resist scope creep
