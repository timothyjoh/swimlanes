=== PHASE 1 REQUIREMENTS ===
Phase 1 MUST include all of the following in its spec:

1. Project scaffolding and dependency installation
2. Choose and configure a test framework appropriate for this stack, WITH code coverage reporting
3. Write initial tests that prove the setup works
4. Create CLAUDE.md at the project root documenting:
   - How to install dependencies
   - How to run the project
   - How to run tests (exact command)
   - How to run tests with coverage (exact command)
   - Project structure overview
5. Create/update README.md at the project root with:
   - Project description
   - Getting started (install, run, test)
   - Any scripts added and how to use them

Phase 1 is the foundation. Every future phase depends on a solid test framework and clear documentation.
