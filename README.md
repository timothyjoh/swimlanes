# SwimLanes

A modern kanban board application built with Astro, React, and SQLite. Organize your work with boards, columns (swim lanes), and draggable cards.

## Features
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Board creation and listing
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Columns and swim lanes with CRUD operations (current)
- 🚧 **Phase 3**: Cards with drag-and-drop (planned)
- 🚧 **Phase 4**: Persistence and polish (planned)

## Tech Stack
- **Astro 5** — SSR framework with API routes
- **React 18** — interactive components
- **TypeScript** — type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **SQLite** — local file-based database
- **Vitest** — fast testing with coverage
